### 
### This code is a simple example of how to write a game of words challenge in Python. 
# It uses a list of words to randomly select a word for the player to guess. 
# The player has 5 lives, and they lose a life for each incorrect guess. 
# The player wins the game if they are able to guess all the letters in the word before they run out of lives.
### To run this code, you will need to save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. 
# For example, if you saved the code as word_challenge.py, you could run it by typing the following command into a command prompt:
# python word_challenge.py
# I hope you will enjoy this game.
